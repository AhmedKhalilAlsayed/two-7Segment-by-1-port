# two-7Segment-by-1-port
using AVR atmega32:
 if you want to use 3 7segments you need about 3 ports to be done! (about>> 3 * 8  = 24 pins )
 so we will use one port for data 'number' for all our 7segment
 and one pin for one 7segment to control ( about>> 8 + (1 * number of 7segment forExample: 3 7segment) = 11 pins )
 then we can use more than 7segment.
